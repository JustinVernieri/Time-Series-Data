# Time-Series-Data
This repository contains a data set on monthly renewable energy consumption from 1973-2024 in the United States, broken down by sector (residential, commercial, transportation, electric power, and industrial) and renewable energy source. Renewable energy consumption is measured in trillion BTUs, or British Thermal Units.

The data dictionary for the data set can be found in the data dictionary csv file.

Data Collection Methodology: The data is collected monthly and annually by the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), which is made publicly available on their official website. Each month, new data is presented, yet it is preliminary and sometimes based on estimates or forecasts. However, at the end of each year, they are revised when the EIA's primary and secondary sources publish final data and survey results and industry reports are finalized. 

I chose this data set because I am intrigued by sustainability's growing presence in the modern world, which is highlighted by renewable energy use. Not only am I a Business Analytics Information Technology major, I am also a Supply Chain Management major, so I think renewable energy data would be fun to analyze as it may provide insights into how businesses are transitioning to sustainable energy and how supply chains adapt to energy shifts.
